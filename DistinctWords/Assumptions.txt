1. Reading line from a file may be done async. But it wouldn't bring any value to the solution, because code would still wait 
for the method to run and return value.

2. Dependent on the definition of word "word", regular expression used in the code would be different.
Now there's just use one that checks out for [A-Za-z0-9_] and ignores other characters.
It won't for example recognize word splited between lines, just will treat those as two separates.

3. Code is not written OO way. Functionalities are not extracted to separate classes, just written as methods in Program.cs file.
This is because I assumed the task concerns algorithmic part of the problem, not desing.
